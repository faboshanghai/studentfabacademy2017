You can use Bootstrap as a template to start with. To edit the html and the css file, you can use an advanced text edit software such as Sublime text for Windows and Brackets for Mac.\

After you make the website you have to put it online, and to do so you need to use GIT. Git is a remote versioning system, it means that you can upload a file on internet, then access to that file from another location, make changes, and get the changes back to your computer. If you want you can scroll back the history of changes you made and revert your file to a previous change.\
\
The basic operation you need to do is to create your account on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.github.com"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul http://www.github.com}}\
Then you have to tell me your username and email used to register and I will give you access to our fablab repository (repository means \'93folder\'94).\
\

\
clone (download) the repository on your computer: create a new folder where you want to store the repository (it is a good idea to put it in a folder called \'93git\'94 inside your main folder for fabacademy 2017)\
